# Banking Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer churn behavior in the banking sector. The goal is to identify key patterns, risk indicators, and actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Problem Statement

Banks face significant financial losses when customers close their accounts. Identifying factors that lead to churn allows the bank to proactively retain customers and improve service offerings.

## Objectives

* Analyze transaction and demographic data to find churn predictors.
* Build visual dashboards to monitor churn trends.
* Provide data-driven recommendations for retention strategies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

* **Customer Demographics** (Age, Gender, Region)
* **Account Information** (Balance, Tenure, Credit Score)
* **Service Usage** (Products used, Activity levels)
* **Churn Label** (Whether the customer left or stayed)

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* **SQL** (Data extraction and aggregation)
* **Power BI** (Interactive dashboards)

## Data Cleaning Steps

* Checked for missing values and outliers.
* Standardized numerical fields.
* Encoded categorical variables.
* Removed duplicate and irrelevant records.

## Key Analysis Performed

* Correlation between churn and account features.
* Customer segmentation by risk levels.
* Trend and demographic analysis.

## Insights & Findings

* Customers with **low account balances** and **high product usage fees** are more likely to churn.
* **New customers** (< 2 years tenure) show higher churn probability.
* Customers with **low engagement** in digital banking services show increased churn risk.

## Dashboard Highlights

* Churn Rate by Age Group
* Churn by Account Balance Tier
* Regional Churn Heatmap
* Customer Retention Funnel

## Recommendations
